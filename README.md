### Using PlaSim for Climate Modelling

The Planet Simulator (PlaSim) is a model of intermediate complexity which is based on the first law of thermodynamics, equations of state, continutiy, and water vapor. This model was used to run a one-year simulation of climate dynamics, and 4 variables of interest were chosen to represent in the below analysis.

The purpose of this analysis was to become familiar with climate modelling and Python libraries for the analysis of netCDF data. In practical cases, convective and large-scale precipitation would probably be combined, and other parameters may arise as more important for future research in this model.
